In March 2020, Luxembourg became the first country to make public transport free. We use this unique setting to evaluate the policyâ€™s impact on carbon emissions. Synthetic difference-in-differences allows us to identify a suitable control group. We use spatial emissions data to construct a panel of NUTS 2 control regions in the EU from 2016 to 2021. Our estimates indicate an average reduction of around 8% in road transport CO2 emissions. We account for potential confounders, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, shifts in commuting behaviors and advancements in vehicle technologies. Robustness checks support the credibility of our results.
