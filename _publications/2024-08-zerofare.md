In March 2020, Luxembourg became the first country to make public transport free. We use this unique setting to evaluate the policyâ€™s impact on carbon emissions. Synthetic difference-in-differences allows us to identify a suitable synthetic comparison to Luxembourg. We use spatial emission data to construct a panel of NUTS 2 control regions in the EU from 2016 to 2021. Our estimates indicate an average reduction of 6.1\% in road transport emissions. We account for the COVID-19 pandemic and other potential confounders, such as shifts in commuting behaviors and advancements in vehicle technologies. Robustness checks support the credibility of our findings.
