I am a final-year PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Graz, Austria.

My research orbits around these core areas:

1. **Environmental Economics** - With a focus on transport-related policies and their implications for emission reductions.
2. **Econometrics** - Time-series analysis, large-N and large-T panels, causal difference-in-differences designs. My goal is to provide evidence-based policy analysis and recommendations.
3. **Spatial Data Analysis** - Exploring the geographical dimensions of economic activities and their socio-economic impacts.

I recently received a two-year research grant from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (Ã–AW) for the project:
**BRidging Inequality in Distance and GEnder: Commuting and Child Penalty in the Austrian Labor Market**

It is together with Riccarda Rosenball (Uni Graz), Jos van Ommeren (VU Amsterdam), and Andrea Weber (CEU). Through this project, we aim to provide empirical evidence on how gender commuting gaps following childbirth contribute to the child penalty in the Austrian labor market. We highlight the career adjustments mothers make to reduce commute times, often at the expense of earnings. Moreover, we explore how improved childcare availability can mitigate these disparities.

### Academic Visits

- **Central European University (CEU), Vienna** - Studying causal inference, enhancing my analytical toolkit to better dissect the cause-and-effect relationships in economics.
- **Spatial Economics Department, VU Amsterdam** - 4-month research stay, learning from leading experts in the field of spatial and urban economics.
