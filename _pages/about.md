Hello! I am a final-year PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Graz, Austria. My journey in academia is driven by a keen interest in unraveling complex economic phenomena related to environmental economics, transport policies, and innovative empirical research methodologies.

### Research Interests

My research orbits around these core areas:

1. **Environmental Economics** - Focusing on evaluating transport-related policies and their implications for sustainable development.
2. **Econometrics** - Delving into time-series analysis, macro-panel studies, and causal difference-in-differences (diff-in-diff) designs to uncover underlying economic patterns and relationships.
3. **Spatial Data Analysis** - Exploring the geographical dimensions of economic activities and their socio-economic impacts.

Recently, I have developed a growing interest in examining gender-related aspects within distance-related (spatial) economics, aiming to contribute to a more inclusive and equitable understanding of spatial economic dynamics.

### Academic Visits

- **Central European University (CEU), Vienna** - Studying causal inference, enhancing my analytical toolkit to better dissect the cause-and-effect relationships in economics.
- **Spatial Economics Department, VU Amsterdam** - 4-month research stay, collaborating with leading experts in the field of spatial and urban economics.
